# SpaceX-Mission-Data ðŸš€

I love knowing when the next SpaceX launch missions are. I wasn't able to easily find a place on the web to show me all the information such as launch data, payload info etc so I made this!

This react app will show the next upcoming launch followed by the last 100 launches.
